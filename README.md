# chai-aur-react
Two commands to start creating react app
1. npx create-react-app my-app 
- > this is not recommended as it includes bulky node modules installation which may or may not be used in the project. 
- > Because it is bulky it takes too long to get everything installed. 

2. npm create vite@latest
- > Vite is a bundler 
- > When this command is executed node modules folder will not be seen and is later installed after running npm i or npm install
